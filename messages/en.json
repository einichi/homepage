After around 1 year in the role, I finished the replacement of approx 250 laptops with a completely new IT stack (moved from on-prem corporate IT to Okta/G-Suite). Also completely replaced legacy networks in Tokyo and Niigata offices with an entirely new network. The Tokyo office was moved to another building shortly after, and I co-ordinated the shift of the entire network and ISP circuits to occur over the weekend and complete just in time for the open of the new office on following Monday. To assist with everyday support, I recruited and managed a small, efficient team of 3 and reported to the APAC IT Manager."

During this time, Experian sold its marketing division to become Cheetah Digital, which I was a part of. As a result of this divestment, product development in Japan was ceased. The VP of Internal IT then asked me to join them to help them stand up a new IT org for Cheetah Digital."
